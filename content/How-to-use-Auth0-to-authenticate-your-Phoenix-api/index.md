Auth0 makes a lot of things easy. Social Logins, Forgot Password, Magic Links, and so on, all across devices. It‚Äôs a useful tool that removes a lot of headaches and overhead in your tech stack.

Though Auth0 is a victim of its own success. A lot of people use it, which means a lot of use cases, which means a lot of features and a pile of documentation. Which at times can be both contradictory and out of date.

As a result, I took the time to create [Auth0_jwks](https://github.com/bnchrch/auth0_jwks). A small library to help everyone use Auth0‚Äôs JWK functionality to authenticate their API endpoints as painlessly as possible.

Below I‚Äôll show you how it‚Äôs used and by the end of this you will

1. Have created a Phoenix API server
1. Setup an Auth0 project
1. Created a small client to retrieve the Auth0 JWT
1. Used that JWT to make a successful call to a protected endpoint in your API.

Well enough preamble, Let‚Äôs get started!
